2015_Reference_Robot
====================

The 2015 reference robot is based on the Trossen PhantomX pan-tilt: http://www.trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-pan-tilt

You'll need a controller to run the robot. The source for the controller can be found in the /hw folder.

Software to run the reference robot is in the /sw folder (TBD).
