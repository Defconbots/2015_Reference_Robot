2015_Reference_Robot
====================

The 2015 reference robot is based on the Trossen PhantomX pan-tilt: http://www.trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-pan-tilt

The laser used for the contest is the **50 mW** version of this laser: http://www.civillaser.com/532nm-5mw50mw-ttl-modulation-green-laser-module-dot-16mmx70mm-p-130.html

You'll need a controller to run the robot. The source for the controller can be found in the /hw folder.

Software to run the reference robot is in the /sw folder (TBD).
